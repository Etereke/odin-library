# Odin Library

Exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library).

The task was to write a small library app where the user can add a few details of books they have read (or want to read), remove books, and set whether they have read the book or not. The purpose of the exercise was practicing object constructors.

The exercise was [later revisited](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-classes#practice) in order to refractor the Book object constructor into Book class. I left the original object constructor version commented out.
